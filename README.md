# Mental Health Repository

My current Linux installation is incredibly peculiar and hard to replicate, 
and because I'm not able to work with anything else anymore I need a place to 
store my config files and scripts.
I will never explain how to use them, but maybe someone might find them useful
(after all, I do make use of a 
[a similar repository](https://gitlab.com/kappanneo/home)) myself.

You might find this useful if one or more of the following conditions apply:

- you use the __i3__ window manager
- you run __Manjaro__ (or some other Arch-based Linux)
- you don't dual boot and don't care about GRUB stuff
- you use __zsh__ (if you don't, try it)
- you use __redshift__ and from time to time geoclue breaks
- you like working with __2 monitors__ but xrandr is too hard

## TODO (aka things that could be better but I can live without fixing right away):
- [ ] change mod key if an external keyboard is connected (or, well, replace 
  laptop keyboard)
- [ ] store all useful layouts created by ARandR and create shortcuts or menu entries for them
- [ ] make it so that all these configs go to the right folder all at once as soon as I reinstall the OS
- [ ] fix the damn "could not start light display manager" issue!
- [ ] update screen layouts
- [ ] fix goeclue, or just don't use it at all and setup shortcuts for redshift
- [ ] fix shortcut for "move workspace to small screen"
- [ ] fix Firefox jumping around
